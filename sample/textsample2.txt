// About Computer

A computer is an electronic device that processes data according to a set of instructions called a program. It performs calculations and 
manipulates information at high speed. Key components include a central processing unit (CPU) for executing instructions, memory for storing data, 
and input/output devices for interaction. Computers are versatile tools used for a vast array of tasks, from communication and entertainment to 
complex scientific research and automation. Their functionality relies on the interplay of hardware and software.

// About Machine learning

Machine learning (ML) is like teaching computers to learn from data without explicitly programming them for every single task. Instead of 
writing specific rules, you feed the computer lots of examples, and it figures out the patterns. Think of it like a child learning to recognize 
a cat by seeing many pictures of cats. ML algorithms are the sets of instructions that enable this learning process.

There are different types of ML, like supervised learning where you provide labeled data (e.g., pictures of cats labeled "cat"). The algorithm 
then learns to predict the label for new, unseen data. Another type is unsupervised learning, where the data isn't labeled, and the algorithm 
tries to find hidden structures or groupings on its own. Imagine sorting a pile of mixed candies into different types without knowing the names 
of the candies beforehand.

Reinforcement learning is like training a dog with rewards and punishments to perform certain actions. The ML model learns through trial and 
error, receiving feedback on its actions. ML is used in many everyday applications, such as recommending movies on Netflix or filtering spam 
emails. It powers facial recognition on your phone and helps self-driving cars navigate.

The more data an ML model has, the better it generally becomes at making predictions or decisions. Building an ML model involves collecting 
data, preparing it, choosing an appropriate algorithm, training the model, and evaluating its performance. It's an iterative process, often requiring adjustments and fine-tuning to achieve the desired results.The goal of ML is to create models that can generalize well to new, unseen data, not just memorize the training data.
